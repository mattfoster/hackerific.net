Yesterday saw the release of two new WSJT-X versions: WSJT-X 2.3.1 (GA) and WSJT-X 2.4.0-rc4.

2.4.0-rc4 has tweaks to Q65 and various other changes. 2.3.1 has bug fixes, updated docs and a few other bits.

The pace of changes to hamlib seems pretty fast at the moment, too. I don't really keep track of that, but it might be worth a look: [https://hamlib.github.io/](https://hamlib.github.io/)

I keep meaning to try the utilities bundled in WSJT-X (and forgetting!)
