Here's the RSGB's statement on the 2m WRC process:

[https://rsgb.org/main/blog/front-page-news/2019/07/01/144-mhz-and-the-wrc-process/](https://rsgb.org/main/blog/front-page-news/2019/07/01/144-mhz-and-the-wrc-process/)

tl;dr: please don't sign any random badly worded petitions, we're on it.

I think (as others have said) continuing to pay the RSGB for membership is probably the best course of action for now.
