Playing with the Airspy HF+ Discovery (or trying to). It works fine with GQRX but the airspy utils, like airspy_rx don't work on my Pi or my Mac.

I *think* I need to update its firmware, but to do that I need to use Windows, so I'll have to do it at work.

Also, since I can't use the airspy tools I can't even work out what firmware release it currently has! Frustrating!
