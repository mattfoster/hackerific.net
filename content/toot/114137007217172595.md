I'm giving a [#talk](https://mastodon.radio/tags/talk) on [#hamradio](https://mastodon.radio/tags/hamradio) in a few weeks at work, and Iâ€™m planning to focus on networks, experimentation and digital modes.

My hope is that I can break the prevailing view that radio is just about old men chatting, by showing a bunch of things software engineers will be interested in.

Luckily there's so much to talk about that picking what to exclude is the problem!

I think I'll cover:

* SDRs + construction

* 44net

* meshtastic

* and then a bit on licensing in the UK.
