Does anyone on @mastodon.radio and in the UK fancy a Gherkin keyboard PCB set? I have two sets of the main PCB, top & bottom plates going spare and will happily post them on.

Info on my builds at: [https://hackerific.net/2017/10/08/building-a-30-key-keyboard/](https://hackerific.net/2017/10/08/building-a-30-key-keyboard/)

and the original idea at:

They're tiny and so hard to use, but super fun!
