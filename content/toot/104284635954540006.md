Went to a virtual club meeting last night, which was pretty interesting.

Roy G0VFS's "VirusPerplexed" bug key is pretty amazing - [https://sites.google.com/site/hamradiog0vfs/projects/virusperplexed-key?authuser=0](https://sites.google.com/site/hamradiog0vfs/projects/virusperplexed-key?authuser=0)

especially when you consider he made it using photos of Vibroplex keys.

The RSGB posted a pic of it as well: [https://rsgb.org/main/blog/radio-amateurs/2020/05/08/roy-bailey-g0vfs-morse-key-lockdown-project/](https://rsgb.org/main/blog/radio-amateurs/2020/05/08/roy-bailey-g0vfs-morse-key-lockdown-project/)

I'm jealous of all these people with all this free time!
