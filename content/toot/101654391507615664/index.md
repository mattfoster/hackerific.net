Didnâ€™t manage to do everything I wanted to this weekend, but I did manage to build my Â£3 crystal tester, and this SOTABEAMS end fed tuner, plus wire it up ready for a test a tune on 40m.

I also managed to make up some test resistors to calibrate my cheap SARK 100 antenna analyser clone.

Actually Iâ€™m pretty happy with that list of stuff!ðŸ¤”
