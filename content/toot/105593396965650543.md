Just reading about the Raspberry Pi Pico: [https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/raspberry-pi-silicon-pico-now-on-sale/](https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/raspberry-pi-silicon-pico-now-on-sale/)

It's a microcontroller rather than a computer like the rest of the Pis but it seems super cheap compared to other similar products and it looks like it'll be well supported.
