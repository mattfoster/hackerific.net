I had no idea the RSGB had a forum: [http://forums.thersgb.org/index.php](http://forums.thersgb.org/index.php)

Nothing like as busy as the unofficial RSGB Tech forum though: [https://groups.io/g/RSGBTechnical](https://groups.io/g/RSGBTechnical)

The latter has some interesting stuff in amongst all of the moaning and one-upmanship.
