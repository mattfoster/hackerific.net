📢 WSJT-X 2.5.0 was announced here: [https://sourceforge.net/p/wsjt/mailman/message/37357178/](https://sourceforge.net/p/wsjt/mailman/message/37357178/)

🗒️ Release notes are here: [https://physics.princeton.edu//pulsar/k1jt/Release_Notes.txt](https://physics.princeton.edu//pulsar/k1jt/Release_Notes.txt)

📁 And downloads are via: [https://physics.princeton.edu//pulsar/k1jt/wsjtx.html](https://physics.princeton.edu//pulsar/k1jt/wsjtx.html)

The release notes say:

"WSJT-X in this release is nearly identical to that in WSJT-X 2.4.0.

The Q65 decoder has been enhanced to measure and compensate for linear

frequency drift in Q65 signals."

So not hugely exciting 🤷, but I expect hamlib has also been updated.
