Had a lot of fun on the clubâ€™s fox hunt last night. It was my first, so I basically went to see how it worked. My team failed (mostly due to a lack of decent gear I reckon) but I will know what to do next time! First on the list is getting my tape measure antenna working.

Looking forward to it!

Whoops, that last but was supposed to be the image description. Not sure what I did there.
