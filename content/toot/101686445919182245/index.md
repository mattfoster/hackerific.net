Just caught some of the SpaceX/NASA Dragon docking webcast. Totally mind blowing (albeit slow) action and a successful dock! In a couple of hours they should be able to open the door and go in.


![A view of the Dragon capsule from the ISS. The capture is a round white object in top right, and a small indistinct second of the ISS in in the bottom left. The capsule has a bulge on top, which is the open nose cone, and several small apertures in a ring, which are part of the docking system.](30430.png)
