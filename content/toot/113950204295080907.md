The Verge has an article on "timeline" apps - [https://www.theverge.com/apps/605756/tapestry-reeder-surf-timeline-apps](https://www.theverge.com/apps/605756/tapestry-reeder-surf-timeline-apps) it's an interesting read.

I've been using Reeder and I've tried Tapestry (which I help kickstart) and I can see the attraction, it's great having a timeline of blog posts, videos, etc that I can just scroll though but I found it pretty useless for mastodon because of the lack of interaction.

Also if you're the sort of person who wants to reliably keep on top of RSS feeds I think a traditional reader will work best.
