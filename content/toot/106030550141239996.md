I wrote a blog about my new split keyboard [https://hackerific.net/2021/04/08/building-a-sofle-keyboard/](https://hackerific.net/2021/04/08/building-a-sofle-keyboard/)

I also put the QMK keymap on github: [https://github.com/mattfoster/sofle-lefty-keymap](https://github.com/mattfoster/sofle-lefty-keymap)
