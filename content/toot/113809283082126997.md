I'm super late to this party, but as an experiment I asked ChatGPT and Cody to write me a browser extension to help manage tabs by letting me close all tabs which have loaded a certain domain.

It worked really well! I had to make a few small code changes, and I'm pretty sure totally non-technical people couldnâ€™t use these tools like this yet, but as a way to scratch as an experiment an itch it's great. It's something I wouldn't have started on my own.

Edit: code at [https://github.com/mattfoster/tab-smasher](https://github.com/mattfoster/tab-smasher)
