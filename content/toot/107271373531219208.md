I hacked a Toaster Oven into a PCB reflow machine.

Basically, I just added a cheap PID controller and a thermocouple, and it was a fun and fairly quick project!

I wrote about it here: [https://hackerific.net/2021/11/13/pcb-toaster/](https://hackerific.net/2021/11/13/pcb-toaster/)

![A modified toaster oven. There's a controller on the right where the dials would be. It has two temperature readouts. Inside is a small PCB. There's a metal wire going through the door. ](https://mastodon.radio/system/media_attachments/files/107/271/369/173/673/628/original/f06be9ea765ef889.jpeg)
