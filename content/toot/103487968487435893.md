It's not currently in stock but this is a great price for "The Art of Electronics (3rd edition)" [https://www.amazon.co.uk/Electronics-Winfield-Hill-Paul-Horowitz/dp/0521809266](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Electronics-Winfield-Hill-Paul-Horowitz/dp/0521809266) Â£23.50!

I must have paid about Â£50 when I was an undergrad back in the 00s ðŸ˜‚
