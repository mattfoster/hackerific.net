Feel pretty pleased with myself, I just built my first home-designed PCB and it worked :alex_grin:

It's the small bidirectional amplifier described here: [http://w7zoi.net/bidirectional_matched_amplifier.pdf](http://w7zoi.net/bidirectional_matched_amplifier.pdf) and built by w2aew here [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TtKE39TWpI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TtKE39TWpI)

I made a couple of footprint mistakes but didn't need any bodge wires! I spent ages messing with KiCad but learned a lot, and have a few ideas for changes. I don't really have a project in mind, but wanted to build something simple I could use to learn.
