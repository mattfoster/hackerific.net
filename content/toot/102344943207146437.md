The PiJuice zero looks nice. It's a UPS/battery management HAT for Pi Zero:

This might be a fun way to make a mobile GPS based clock or maybe an APRS module, if it's stackable with the boards [@M0YNG](https://mastodon.radio/@M0YNG) has.

Pi Supply is a UK company, so I expect they'll be available direct eventually for us brits ( [https://uk.pi-supply.com/collections/pijuice](https://uk.pi-supply.com/collections/pijuice) has some larger HATs for full sized Pi boards), but the shipping cost seems fairly reasonable.
