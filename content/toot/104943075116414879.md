The first release candidate for WSJT-X 2.3.0 is out.

This release adds two new modes for LF/MF, called FST4 and FST4W.

I had heard some rumours about this but not looked into them!

I've not managed to install this on my Pi, despite it running the Buster version of Rasbpian, there's no version of libgfortran that's new enough.

But considering I'm not on 2200 and 630 m that's no great loss!

Ahh, the deps are wrong, expecting an updated package at some point.
