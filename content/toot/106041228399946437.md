I got a digirig after seeing someone here post about them. It arrived earlier this week and I just made some cabled to connect it to the FT818.

So far I am super impressed! Also, I learned the 818 can do CAT controlled PTT.

Details at: [https://digirig.net/why-digirig/](https://digirig.net/why-digirig/) and [https://www.qrz.com/db/K0TX](https://www.qrz.com/db/K0TX). I'll write up my experiences shortly.
