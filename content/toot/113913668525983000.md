On my way from a work event at Glaziers Hall in London where I saw this amazing stained glass panel depicting Faraday and Newton. It’s the coat of arms of “The worshipful company of scientific instrument makers”.

I found some interesting information at [https://wcsim.co.uk](https://wcsim.co.uk)


![A stained glass coat of arms depicting a man in red robes on the left and a man in dark robes on the right. The man on the left is Faraday and is holding an inductor. The man on the right is Newton holding a telescope. In the centre at the top is a depiction of Minerva, in gold and in the centre under miners a is a knight’s helmet on top of a shield with a picture of a stack of blue and yellow cubes. Finally across the bottom is the motto “Sine Nobis Scientia Languet”](https://mastodon.radio/system/media_attachments/files/113/913/668/306/272/327/original/3c6a502ab92a621d.jpeg)
