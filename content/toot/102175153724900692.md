I highly recommend the Ham Radio & Electronics Stackoverflow weekly newsletters.

They bundle up the top questions each week and mail them out, which makes for a quick and easy way to learn a few interesting things.

To signup, go to your SO account (on any instance) find your profile and navigate to newsletters.
