My linear PSU just died. âš¡ Symptoms are 23 Volts across the terminals instead of the normal 13.8. What a terrible failure mode!

Hoping it might be easy to fix, but it doesn't really owe me anything.

It's one of these bog standard models ( [https://www.eham.net/reviews/detail/4064](https://www.eham.net/reviews/detail/4064)) which I got from [@Powyssafety](https://mastodon.radio/@Powyssafety) last year.
