Powershell on Linux eh? Whatever next [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/setup/installing-powershell-core-on-linux?view=powershell-6](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/setup/installing-powershell-core-on-linux?view=powershell-6)

I've been around for long enough to not trust Microsoft, but I'm really hoping this is being done because people find it useful and not as some long term evil strategy!
