I'm learning a lot while trying to get my CNC producing decent output. Having to delve into schematic capture and PCB design, which I've not done since uni days, followed by conversion to gcode, levelling and milling.

In gcode the learning curve is basically Y10 (ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èsorry, bad joke).


I picked kicad because I don‚Äôt like the idea of being beholden to Autodesk, and I‚Äôm a Linux/Mac person, but it‚Äôs pretty complicated. Quite a lot to take in!
