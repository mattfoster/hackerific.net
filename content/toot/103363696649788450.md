Happy Holidays everyone!

Here's hoping everyone gets a bit of quality time with some random projects 🥂

So far, I've repaired Dad's PSU (it works!) and build a new 60% mechanical keyboard. Some info here: [https://github.com/mattfoster/gh60-satan-keymap](https://github.com/mattfoster/gh60-satan-keymap) Fun times!
