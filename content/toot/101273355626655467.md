Wow, these tiny Korg valves look amazing: [https://korgnutube.com/en/](https://korgnutube.com/en/)

I wonder how long it'll be before someone makes a radio with them in.

It looks like RS are selling headphone amp kits which use them [https://uk.rs-online.com/web/p/analogue-development-kits/1813534/](https://uk.rs-online.com/web/p/analogue-development-kits/1813534/)

Expensive though!
