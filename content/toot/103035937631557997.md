This weekend Dad ([@Powyssafety](https://mastodon.radio/@Powyssafety)) visited and we upgraded my antenna pole! We managed to make it a fair bit higher, so I'm hoping it won't offend anyone enough to cause complaints, but that hasn't happened so far!

I'm looking forward to seeing what difference having the white stick above the roof line makes, after rejigging some cables and maybe adding some surge protection.

Now I need to get back into the tree and see if I can raise things a bit on that end too!
