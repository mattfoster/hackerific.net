Had a quick go with a mini whip antenna (in my loft) any my new HF+ discovery.

I powered it with a cheap lab PSU and the noise floor raised enormously from ~ -85 dB to -60 dB with regularly spaced carriers.

Definitely amplifying a load of crud from in my house and presumably the PSU isn't helping!
