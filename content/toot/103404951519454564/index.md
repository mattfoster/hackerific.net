Today's project was Cordwood Puzzle 1, a secret santa present from a good mate.

Just hard enough to complete without cheating! (although I should have left the leads longer to keep things symmetrical).

Oh, and Happy New Year all!

![A PCB in a clamp. There are three MOSFETs in a row along the top of the board, and a 6 pin header close to the camera. ](146014.jpeg)

![The same PCB from the side. There's a large LED on the bottom of the board and two resistors on the top. The resistors are connected with crocodile clips (to the positive supply rail which is not shown).](146015.jpeg)

![The completed puzzle: two PCBs, side-on, with 6 LEDs, 6 resistors on a plane parallel with the camera and another 6 behind. There are also standoffs connecting the boards and some jumpers running between them. ](146016.jpeg)
