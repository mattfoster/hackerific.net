I've been meaning to get back into interactive on masto for a while now, so I think it's time for a re- [#introduction](https://mastodon.radio/tags/introduction) :alex_grin:

I'm a not-very-active ham, first licensed in late 2017 (got my full license in mid-2018).

My toddler and job limit my free time a lot, but I really enjoy seeing people post projects here & love the radio newsletters that have sprung up over the last few years.

I'm interested in data modes, [#electronics](https://mastodon.radio/tags/electronics), [#infosec](https://mastodon.radio/tags/infosec), [#security](https://mastodon.radio/tags/security), [#hardware](https://mastodon.radio/tags/hardware) [#hacking](https://mastodon.radio/tags/hacking), etc.
