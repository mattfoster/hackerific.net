I just had a cheap AliExpress PL-259 patch cable fall apart in my hands. I guess you get what you pay for!


![On the left is a section of coax cable. Stripped and with the braid showing. On the right is a PL-259 crimp plug which has a heat shrink tube still attached. The coax fell out as it wasnâ€™t properly attached. ](134359.jpeg)

It was so badly crimped I was able to reuse the plugs and sleeves to make a new cable, with a slightly nicer bit of coax.
