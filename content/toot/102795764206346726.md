Everyone is going wild about Chinese NanaVNA clones. They're tiny, pretty decent, cheap and computer controllable.

There's a new groups.io group @ [https://groups.io/g/nanovna-users](https://groups.io/g/nanovna-users) and discussions on them almost everywhere.

Mine shipped with no battery, and someone on the users list recommends 602040 Li-Po. I could find something in an old gadget but it would need to be super thin, so I've ordered one.

NanoVNA-saver currently looks to be the best software: [https://github.com/mihtjel/nanovna-saver](https://github.com/mihtjel/nanovna-saver)

Cool!
