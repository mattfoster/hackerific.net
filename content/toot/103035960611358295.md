Recently, I've been playing with chezmoi ( [https://github.com/twpayne/chezmoi](https://github.com/twpayne/chezmoi)) as a way to manage my shell/editor config files, and I've re-architected my old zsh framework to use the more modern zplug plugin manager ( [https://github.com/zplug/zplug](https://github.com/zplug/zplug)).

I've been storing my configs in both github ( [https://github.com/mattfoster/dotfiles](https://github.com/mattfoster/dotfiles)) and keybase, and finding it a great way to keep home/work configs up to date as I make changes.

I have a bunch of random projects and scripts laying about that I'll merge/add as I get time.
