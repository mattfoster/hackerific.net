So, my geiger counter supports serial and wifi, and will report readings to this (insecure) website: [http://www.gmcmap.com/](http://www.gmcmap.com/) using this (super-dodgy, http only, unauthenticated) API: [http://www.gmcmap.com/AutomaticallySubmitData.asp](http://www.gmcmap.com/AutomaticallySubmitData.asp)

Presumably this site isn't intended as anything but a toy!
