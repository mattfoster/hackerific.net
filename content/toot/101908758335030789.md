Interesting news on the new Nvidia Jeston boards on the "other" site: [https://twitter.com/F5OEOEvariste/status/1116368783982174208](https://twitter.com/F5OEOEvariste/status/1116368783982174208)

These are small form factor machines with a load of GPU cores, and they look a bit beefier than RPis. Could be fun!
