Helping Dad get LoTW working (again!) with the QRZ Logbook.

It turned out he had applied for new certs and was still using the old ones in the QRZ log, and it was only possible to see the export was failing via the low site.

While I really appreciate the nerdery that went into the design of the LOTW system it could definitely be a bit more user-friendly.

Also the QRZ logbook seems a lot less fully featured than most other logging software I've looked at, and that's all been free.
