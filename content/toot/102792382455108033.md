Using "the most pointless Docker command ever" ( [https://zwischenzugs.com/2015/06/24/the-most-pointless-docker-command-ever/](https://zwischenzugs.com/2015/06/24/the-most-pointless-docker-command-ever/)) to look inside the VM Docker for macOS uses.

I'm not sure where the image comes from but it's pretty small and slick, and I'm unsure how I'd get a shell on it without the hack!

(my next toot will be radio related....maybe)
