Happy to report that much lunchtime work talk went pretty well! Had about 30 people watch, and some questions.

I had a weird glitch in iA Presenter (I love markdown presentation tools so was playing) where the images disappeared, but it has decent version control so I was able to recover.

Anyway, slides and speaker notes are at: [https://files.hackerific.net/ham-radio-2025-03-28.pdf](https://files.hackerific.net/ham-radio-2025-03-28.pdf) (54MB!)

I mainly added the notes to save me if I got stuck, so then I spoke a bit more than planned, and 30 mins was a bit short :alex_grin:


I polished up the text and posted it along with slides to my blog [https://blog.hackerific.net/2025/03/29/ham-radio-not-just-for-old-men/](https://blog.hackerific.net/2025/03/29/ham-radio-not-just-for-old-men/)
