This story about repairing the Salyut 7 space station is amazing: [https://arstechnica.com/science/2014/09/the-little-known-soviet-mission-to-rescue-a-dead-space-station/](https://arstechnica.com/science/2014/09/the-little-known-soviet-mission-to-rescue-a-dead-space-station/)

Found through an awesome colleague who I’ve yet to convince needs a [#hamradio](https://mastodon.radio/tags/hamradio) license. He’s heard too many “grumpy old man” stories and is a bit shy.
