Nice, a new RadCom plus issue:

[https://rsgb.org/main/blog/front-page-news/2019/10/30/radcom-plus-vol-4-no-1/](https://rsgb.org/main/blog/front-page-news/2019/10/30/radcom-plus-vol-4-no-1/)

Not sure there has been one of these released since I joined.

It's a shame the subscription process is such a farce though. The email called it quick and easy and the link took me to the RSGB shop, (which looks like it's from 1990), and then I had to supply a load of details to subscribe!
