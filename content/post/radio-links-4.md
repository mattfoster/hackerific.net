Whoops, a few months went by without me posting anything. That wasn't because
of a lack of anything to post, it was just me being rubbish and largely
ignoring the internet and social media while the American election happened. 
Since my [previous post](https://hackerific.net/2020/07/03/radio-links-3-june-2020/) 
I've seen a few cool things worth sharing, including some new SDRs, information
on sharing antennas for RX systems and some interesting articles from someone
new to radio.

## RX888 

RX888 SDRs have hit the internet over the last few months and they look pretty
interesting. They're based on a 16-bit ADC called the
[LTC2208](https://www.analog.com/en/products/ltc2208.html#) and can directly
sample the _whole_ HF band, up to 32 MHz. Perhaps unsurprisingly they are not
cheap, retailing at about Â£130 on AliExpress, but compared to other SDRs that's
not bad. Also, they're based on the ideas of an Italian engineer called Oscar,
whose
[blog](http://www.steila.com/blog/index.php?controller=post&action=view&id_post=32)
and second [SDR prototypes blog](https://sdr-prototypes.blogspot.com)
are both worth reading.

## "1 antenna to 15 radios with no loss" 

[Frugal Radio](https://frugalradio.com) covers connecting a single antenna to
15 receivers, using [multicouplers](https://frugalradio.com/multicouplers/),
well he actually uses a TV drop amp, which is a cheaper alternative. The
article and companion youtube videod are both worth a look if you want to see 
how much you can do with very few antennas.

## You're Almost Entirely Blind: A Guided Tour of the RF Spectrum

In [The Dork
Web](https://thedorkweb.substack.com/p/youre-almost-entirely-blind), Steve Lord
takes us on a tour of the RF spectrum. This edition of his fortnightly newsletter 
is jam packed full of radio nerdery and really does cover a massive amount of spectrum.
I'd stronly suggest that you read it and then subscribe!

## FV-1 based SDR

*Update*: here's one I forgot! [CIRCUIT SALAD](https://circuitsalad.com) has an update 
on his FV-1 DSP based SDR project. I hadn't seen the original until I found this, but 
this is an interesting project using a DSP chip which appears to be designed for use 
in effects pedals. It's also programmed using an interesting visual programming system.
Check out [this blog post](https://circuitsalad.com/2020/11/13/the-fv-1-based-sdr-revisited/)
for more details.
