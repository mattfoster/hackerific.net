This is a short and hopefully sweet post with a quick tip I use in Pinboard **all
the time**, but which as far as I can tell other people don't really know about.
I'm also always surprised when I try pinboard apps and they don't support this feature.

You may already know about the [Popular](https://pinboard.in/popular) page on
the barebones-and-yet-super-awesome bookmarking site
[Pinboard](https://pinboard.in/), but did you know you can also drill down by tag?

Well, you can, and it's surprisingly simple, just shove the tag after
`/popular/t:`. So, supposing you want popular links about Markdown, just visit:

> https://pinboard.in/popular/t:markdown

Want iOS, that's:

> https://pinboard.in/popular/t:ios

and OSX is:

> https://pinboard.in/popular/t:osx/

Although presumably people will start using macOS soon! 

You'll probably have noticed the tag prefix (`t:`) elsewhere in pinboard as
well, such as after usernames (which are prefixed with `u:`), and so I suppose
it's also possible that there are other ways of searching too.

Hopefully you find this quick tip as useful as I do.
