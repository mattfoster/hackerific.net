This month saw the release of macOS Sierra, the one with the name change. Along
with that came some pretty hefty changes to iTunes Music. Some of these changes
are cute, like curated playlists, but others, like the removal of most
lists of new music, are not so nice. I'm still trying to work out the best way
to discover new music, now that I can't view lists of all new albums, but I'm
sure I'll think of something. Fortunately, it didn't stop me finding plenty of
great material for this month's post, and as ever, the music below is in no
particular order.

## Monte Pittman - Inverted Grasp of Balance

First off, we have this album by none other than Madonna's Guitarist,
[Monte Pittman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Pittman). He's clearly not
just a pop guitarist because this album is a beast, not prog, but hard-hitting
full on metal that's pretty refreshing, and pretty good to run to as well.

## Lotus Thief - Gramarye

This band defies description, so here's what they say on Bandcamp:

> Lotus Thief is a San Francisco band that merges post-black metal, space rock
> and ambient music, seamlessly blending the genres into a unique and greater musical whole.

This is amazing turned up really really loud, and despite the black metal
influences there's not much rough singing here. It's chiefly clean and choral
female angelic vocals, with just the odd little growl thrown in for good measure!

## Alcest - Kodama

It's fair to say that Alcest is a genre-defining post-metal band, and that their
last album put some people off. Well, in this album they return to the more
traditional blackgaze style of "Les Voyages de l'Âme", which will please a lot
of people. In the words of the top review on iTunes:

> Relaxing, evocative... beautiful. This album will transport the listener
> away to a magical place where they can escape from all of the day's distress.

That sums it up perfectly.

## Doom duo: Mammoth Weed Wizard Bastard - Y Proffwyd Dwyll

Mammoth Weed are clearly not bothered about non-welsh speakers pronouncing the
name of their album, but don't let that put you off because you'll be hard pressed
to find more awesome doom metal, and the angelic sounding vocals fit perfectly
with the slow chugging guitar sound.

## Temples - Holy Serpent

A last minute addition to September's post, Holy Serpent is another doom record,
but this time it's a little more rocky, with an amazingly raw sound. Definitely
worth a listen because this rocks.

## Helen Money - Become Zero

Finally this month, we have something a bit different. Helen Money's music
puts me in mind of Godspeed, except that the tracks are all far shorter, and the
build-ups are actually more intense. There's a massive amount of emotion packed
into each track, so when each track ends it's almost a relief. Finally, there's
an excellent
[Guardian Article](https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/sep/20/helen-money-become-zero-album-bereavement)
on how the album came to be.
