The last few weeks have seen a lot of exceptional new releases. Hardly a day goes
by when Apple Music's New page doesn't have some juicy metal to digest.
We've seen albums from [Haken](https://itun.es/gb/2a63ab), 
[Deftones](https://itun.es/gb/g-ktab), [Desaster](https://itun.es/gb/4SXRab), 
[Cult of Luna & Julie Christmas](https://itun.es/gb/BXlIab) and 
[Painted Wives](https://itun.es/gb/SlKnbb). Some of these are excellent albums,
but for this post I want to step slightly outside the world of mainstream metal
and focus on some slightly difference releases.

First off, [Radiohead's A Moon Shaped Pool](https://itun.es/gb/psvqcb) deserves
a mention. The first single, Burn The Witch, is undoubtedly the most immdiately
accessible track here, but listen more and there's a lot of great post-prog to
dig into. If you're a fan of artists signed to
[Kscope](http://www.kscopemusic.com), you'll love this. I know I do. This isn't
the Radiohead you used to listen to, it's much, much better!

Talking of kscope, [Se Delan's Drifter](https://itun.es/gb/hC1bbb)
is a new release from them that definitely needs checking out. Se Delan
consists of Justin Greaves from Crippled Black Pheonix and the singer Belinda
Kordic, and these guys make a great team. Have a look at their 
[home page](http://www.kscopemusic.com/artists/se-delan/) to see some awesome
album art, albums streams and a related podcast.

I discovered [Wistful by Sylvain](https://itun.es/gb/BP3ibb) on 
[Heavy Blog](http://www.heavyblogisheavy.com/2016/05/12/sylvaine-wistful/),
which -- in a fairly long winded -- way says it's like Alcest's most recent
offerings, only *better*. Since first hearing it, I've had this on repeat and I
have to agree, this has the soaring shoegaze, the black metal vocals and the
epic buildup you are looking for!

Finally, the self titled [Mirrors for Psychic Warfare](https://itun.es/gb/dzXJbb) is
ambient, dark and poetic. This could be part of a genre I've not fully
explored, but I'd like to think it stands alone. I found this view Apple Music,
then discovered that 
[Heavy Blog](http://www.heavyblogisheavy.com/2016/04/27/hey-listen-to-mirrors-for-psychic-warfare/)
covered it too. When there are lyrics they're dark and poetic, and inexplicably put me in mind of
[The Southern Reach](http://www.jeffvandermeer.com) trilogy. 

Have I missed any alternative metal or rock this month? Let me know in the comments.
