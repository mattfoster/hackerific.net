Changes to Apple Music have had more of an adverse affect on my discovery process
than I hoped, and so this post has been a long time coming. In writing this, I've
delved through my own discoveries as well as a some of my favourite musical blogs, 
[Dark Hemyspheres](http://music.thedigitalfix.com/content/id/22053/dark-hemyspheres-january-2017.html),
[Doom charts](https://doomcharts.com/2017/02/01/the-doom-charts-for-january-2017/)
and [Stoned Meadow of Doom](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCknVpWR6m2Ijzkqo-aPXs_g).
The result is a mix of albums which came out in December 2017 and January 2017. Enjoy! 

## Dopelord – Children Of The Haze

Hell yes! This is easily my album of the month. This is heavy stoner doom/rock
with an old school feel and absolutly stupid lyrics.

If you're partial to a bit of clean singing (about bongs mostly), and you like
your riffs about as slow as humanly possible then you need to check this out!

## Echolocation - Gone is Gone

Gone is Gone is a "supergroup" formed from some bits of Mastodon and Queens of
the Stone age. There are some great clean vocals here, as well as some pretty
crushing guitars. Overall, I'd love some of it to be a bit heavier but it's
still a great listen even though it might not an album you have on heavy
rotation forever.

## Ancetral Voices - Yantra - EP

Yantra is best (by me) described as 'Raime-like'. This is ambient, electronic
and atmospheric. My [brother](http://robinfoster.net/) describes it as 'music
techy', but I've found this sort of music perfect for long sessions of work
where I need to concentrate. That may not sounds like a ringing endorsement,
but it actually is!

## Black Anvil - As Was

Lifted straight from the Dark Hemypsheres post this has been described as black
metal but probably isn't, as the guitar sound is just too clean. But don't let
that put you off, as there are some amazing riffs to be found here.

## Gösta Berlings Saga - Sersophane

Let's finish off with some awesome instrumental prog rock that has it all
(apart from vocals!). The guitar work in this album is amazing, and lends each
track an upbeat feel, if you like this (and you probably will), there's a good
chance it'll make you smile while you listen!
