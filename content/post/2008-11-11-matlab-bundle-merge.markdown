I've successfully committed [Thomas Kjosmoen's](http://kjosmoen.org/) matlab bundle changes into the (relocated) macromates [SVN repository](http://svn.textmate.org/trunk/Bundles/Matlab.tmbundle/). His work is absolutely stellar, so I recommend you grab the bundle ASAP. I've also managed to keep the useful extensions I made to the previous incarnation intact.

As ever I'm eager to hear your feedback and bug reports. Either directly, or via the [google group](https://groups.google.com/group/matlab-tmbundle). The code is also available in [GitHub](http://github.com/mattfoster/matlab-tmbundle/tree/master "mattfoster's matlab-tmbundle at master &mdash; GitHub") for your forking pleasure.
