For me, July has been completely dominated by Gojira's Magma. Having not been a
fan in the past, the fact that I'm enjoying this so much came as something of a
shock... Especially the vocals, which seem a bit cleaner than on their previous
albums.  Overall, this seems a bit more progressive on past albums, as
well as less aggressive. Check it out.

Next up, I've been loving Inter Arma's Paradise Gallows. There's a lot of
different material packed into this album, from full-on stoner to screamy doom,
something for everyone! Check out the video for "The Summer Drones":

While on the subject of stoner, I was lucky enough to see The Melvins play at
the Exchange in Bristol last month.  The Melvins are a band I've been aware of
but not a huge fan of for a while, but I've enjoyed the last of their many,
many, albums.  Well, live they were absolutely awesome, and "Basses Loaded" is
a perfect way to describe the latest album. Worth a listen, even better if you
can see/feel them live ü§òüèº
