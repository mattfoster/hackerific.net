I've discovered a lot of high quality newsletters in the last couple of weeks
(for example [The Dork Web](https://thedorkweb.substack.com/)),
and while I don't think I'm ready to take things as far as making one myself, I
do find a lot of interesting links to share while I'm busy being lazy.
So, this is issue one of Rad[io] Links, an unordered list of interesting things
I've found on the web, expect radio, electronics, tech productivity,
programming and anything else I find that's interesting. If I can, I'll do this
regularly.

## Hot Iron

Hot Iron is an opinionated and always interesting quarterly magazine/newsletter
about ham radio. This pulls bits and bobs from around the web, combines it with
reader submissions and the result is a bit like a cross between SPRAT and
POC||CTFO.

To sign up, you need to send an email (yes, but do it). Details are at

## Simple low current mini-whip antenna

Everyone loves project blogs. I love just how much information there is in this post about
[a little glowing active antenna](https://circuitsalad.com/2020/02/13/simple-low-current-mini-whip-antenna/).
It uses an LT1818 opamp, instead of a JFET/BJT. This has the advantage that the IC
is in production and costs about Â£1.74 in low quantities, and has a wide bandwidth.

The 3D printed case and LED look great together, and the schematic is super simple.

## N7DDC Automatic ATU boards

These [ATUs](https://github.com/Dfinitski/N7DDC-ATU-100-mini-and-extended-boards)
look like they're relay switched blocks of inductors and capacitors. The
github repo doesn't do the _best_ job of listing features but the schematic
shows 5 caps and 5 inductors, and is that an SWR bridge on the bottom left? I
guess it must be for this to be automatic. Kits are readily available on eBay
and AliExpress, just search for "N7DDC". I have ordered one but it's stuck at
work, and I'm not able to go there (ðŸ¦ ).

## Hackaday

Finally, I was browsing [hackaday.io](https://hackaday.io) and found the [`ham
radio`](https://hackaday.io/projects?tag=ham%20radio) tag interesting. Here's
are a couple of nice projects:

* [Junk box noise
  source](http://www.lifeatwarp9.com/2017/05/curiously-strong-junk-box-noise-source/) - a wideband noise source using cheap bits.

* [Portable discone
  antenna](https://hackaday.io/project/169167-portable-discone-antenna).
  Discones are wideband antennas which are particularly good for using with
  scanners.

## Bye!

I hope you like this little list. Please feel free to leave a comment if you've
got something cool I should see.
