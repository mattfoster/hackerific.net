In September 2018 I went to my first Radio Buildathon and Hamvention, they were
great fun, and made even better by the fact that the G-QRP club convention was
co-sited with the Hamfest.

[Telford Hamfest](http://www.telfordhamfest.org.uk/) and the [G-QRP Convention](http://www.gqrp.com/convention.htm)
are annual events which run in Ironbridge, a small town famous for having a very old cast iron bridge. 
As well as the Hamfest, the G-QRP buildathon ran the night before in a hotel in Telford.
This year, I was lucky enough to hitch a lift up with Steve G0FUW and Lewis
G4YTN and so went to all three events. 

## G-QRP Buildathon

A Buildathon is an even in which participants build an electronic kit, they are
an excellent way to meet like-minded people, get excellent value kits to build
and create something potentially useful.  This year, the Buildathon kit was
designed by [Heather M0HMO](http://www.myorangedragon.com/), and was described
as an HF Swiss Army Knife. 

This amazing little thing consists of an Arduino clone, OLED display, GPS receiver and
SWR bridge, and it can do a massive amount of things, including:

* Measure RF forward and reflected power and SWR,
* Measure HF frequency
* Resistance
* Voltage
* UTC time, using the GPS
* Latitude and Longitude, also using the GPS
* Maidenhead grid square.

Not surprisingly, this took some building, especially since the indoor lighting made distinguishing resistors colours hard, but I think that almost everyone there ended up with a complete and working, and _calibrated_ unit!

The finished unit runs off a 9V battery, and just needs a case and maybe an external antenna for the GPS receiver. 

This was great fun to build, and was definitely the highlight of the weekend for me. Heather has uploaded the instructions, source code and Gerbers etc. To her website.
