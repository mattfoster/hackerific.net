In September 2018 I went to my first Radio Buildathon and Hamvention, they were
great fun, and made even better by the fact that the G-QRP club convention was
co-sited with the Hamfest.

[Telford Hamfest](http://www.telfordhamfest.org.uk/) and the [G-QRP Convention](http://www.gqrp.com/convention.htm)
are annual events which run in Ironbridge, a small town famous for having a very old cast iron bridge. 
As well as the Hamfest, the G-QRP buildathon ran the night before in a hotel in Telford.
This year, I was lucky enough to hitch a lift up with Steve G0FUW and Lewis
G4YTN and so went to all three events.

A Buildathon is an even in which participants build an electronic kit, they are

and create something potentially useful.  This year, the Buildathon kit was
designed by [Heather M0HMO](http://www.myorangedragon.com/), and was described
as an HF Swiss Army Knife. 

This amazing little thing consists of an Arduino clone, OLED display, GPS and
SWR bridge, and according it can do a massive amount of things, including:
