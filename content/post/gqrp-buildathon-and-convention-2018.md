In September 2018 I went to my first Radio Buildathon and Hamvention, they were
great fun, and made even better by the fact that the G-QRP club convention was
co-sited with the Hamfest so I got to go to that as well!

[Telford Hamfest](http://www.telfordhamfest.org.uk/) and the [G-QRP
Convention](http://www.gqrp.com/convention.htm) are annual events which run in
Ironbridge, a small town famous for having a very old iron bridge.  As well as
the Hamfest, the G-QRP buildathon ran the night before in a hotel in the nearby
Telford.  This year, I was lucky enough to hitch a lift up with Steve G0FUW and
Lewis G4YTN and so went to all three events.

## G-QRP Buildathon

A Buildathon is an even in which participants build an electronic kit. They are
an excellent way to meet like-minded people, get excellent value kits to build
and create something useful. The actual even was run by the almost legendary Bath
Buildathon Team (Steve, Lewis and friends), and this year, the Buildathon kit was
designed by [Heather M0HMO](http://www.myorangedragon.com/), and was described
as an HF Swiss Army Knife.

This amazing little thing consists of an Arduino clone, OLED display, GPS receiver and
SWR bridge, and it can do a massive amount of things, including:

* Measure RF forward and reflected power and SWR,
* Measure HF frequency
* Resistance
* Voltage
* UTC time, using the GPS
* Latitude and Longitude, also using the GPS
* Maidenhead grid square.

Not surprisingly, this took some building, especially since the indoor lighting
made distinguishing resistors colours hard, but I think that almost everyone
there ended up with a complete and working, and _calibrated_ unit! My Dad's
(MW6KPF) eyes nearly fell out during the course of the evening, mostly due to
problems reading the tiny resistors! People also found soldering the screen
across the middle of the board pretty hard.

The finished unit runs off a 9V battery, and to tidy it up it needs a case and
maybe an external antenna for the GPS receiver.

Overall, this was great fun to build, and was definitely the highlight of the weekend
for me. Heather has uploaded the instructions, source code and gerbers etc. to
[her website](http://myorangedragon.com/radio/hfswissarmyknife.html), so the kit
is also ready to hack!

## Telford Hamvention

The Hamvention was exactly what I expected! A dark warehouse like room (part of
the museum [Enginuity](https://www.ironbridge.org.uk/explore/enginuity/)), with
rows of tables covered in _stuff_. There were lots of stalls from companies like
[SOTABEAMS](https://www.sotabeams.co.uk/) and
[Kanga](https://www.kanga-products.co.uk/), clubs like the G-QRP club, and the
rest of the space was pretty much full of random bits of test gear, radios,
components and junk (wow there was a lot of junk!). It was great fun to look
around and all the bits and bobs, and to stop myself from buying too much
random stuff I wouldn't need!

## G-QRP Convention

The G-QRP club's mini convention was held in the same building as the hamfest,
only upstairs. There were three (almost) one hour sessions and all three talks
were excellent!

The first was on a student built mini satellite called the [Flying Laptop
Project](https://directory.eoportal.org/web/eoportal/satellite-missions/f/flying-laptop).
The speaker, Barry Cook G8PHG, was involved in the engineering some of the
electronics for the satellite and the result was a fascinating talk in which I learned about
[Magnetorquers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetorquer) and various other
facts concerning all aspects of satellite design (e.g. it's pretty
common for rockets to carry dozens of satellites up in a single launch!). Barry
is an absolute gold mine of interesting facts!

Next was a talk by Vic Winton GW4JUN, on The G-QRP GM3OXX Memorial Construction
Challenge.  This is a challenge to have a 1 Watt QSO using home made gear,
which sounds like a fun thing to try.  The second half of his talk contained a
lot of handy info on learning CW in a way which avoids common pitfalls. When I
finally pluck up the nerve to get started properly I hope I can remember what
he talked about!

Finally, there was a live [Solder Smoke](http://www.soldersmoke.com/). This is
a podcast I wasn't familiar with until just before the convention, and it is
excellent. The presenters talk about all aspects of radio electronics and construction
and are entertaining as well. The episode was primarily a really well thought
out list of interesting things from the G-QRP magazine, SPRAT, along with what
made them interesting. It made an excellent homage to the club, and an awesome
introduction to the podcast for me.

The [Solder Smoke blog](http://soldersmoke.blogspot.com/) is a great read, and
you can hear about 15 minutes of the live session at the end of [episode
206](http://www.soldersmoke.com/soldersmoke206.mp3).

All in all, this was an excellent weekend, and I'm hoping I'll manage to go
next year too.
