I've seen a couple of miserable sounding posts suggesting that there's not been
much good dark music this month, and I have to say that I disagree! For me, the
month started with Supernormal festival, where I saw some amazing bands, like 
Ashtray Navigations, The Cush, Tomaga and Heather Leigh, and then when I got
back from that cool bands kept releasing cool albums. This post is about a few of them.

## Triumphia - Imminent Sonic Destruction

First off, we have an album which might be the most *prog* thing I've ever heard.
Triumphia by Imminent Sonic Destruction -- what a ridiculous name! This album
covers the whole gamut, ranging from chilled ballads to proper chugging guitars
with screams. The vocalist takes a little while to get used to, and the vocals
alone will probably put some people off, but this is amazing music, so give it a listen.

## SubRosa - For This We Fought the Battle of Ages

I can't find a youtube video for this one, but here's another great album you
should definitely listen to. I'd not heard of Subrosa before this album, but
this is a [band](https://subrosa.cc/bio/) calling itself:

> SubRosa is an experimental sludge-doom metal band from Salt Lake City, Utah.
> Within the SubRosa crucible, sludgy low-end and crushing volume mix with
> melodic folk and experimental elements delivered through the haunting
> ambiance of two electric violins. The overall effect is dark, emotional,
> bleak, and beautiful.

This is what would happen if My Dying Bridge went sludgy and ditched the clean
(male) vocals.

## Orphaned Land & Amaseffer - Kna'an

Here's a pretty cool collaboration, Orphaned Land's cool guitar sound matches
up really well with the Amaseffer vocal style. The result sounds much like
you'd expect!

## Moloken - All Is Left Too See

Another recommendation from [Heavy Blog](http://www.heavyblogisheavy.com/2016/08/26/exclusive-premiere-the-beginning-of-the-end-is-here-via-moloken/),
this is a beauty. This is another band you can't pigeonhole, with a cool mix of
black metal, doom and sludge, the closing track is epic, so watch it below.

## AWOOGA - Alpha

Here's a band I heard about from the mailing list of another band (Amplifier).
This is a three-piece up north somewhere, playing:

> ... their signature sound. A brooding hybrid of space-rock psychedelia,
> sludgy doom with a generous nod to the golden age of alternative rock.

and what a signature sound it is! Check it out!
