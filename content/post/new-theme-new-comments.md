It has a been a while since I last posted, and I'm not sure where the year has
gone. Actually, scrub that, I'm not sure where the _decade_ has gone! Anyway,
in my end-of-year holiday I've been doing a bit of catching up and decided a
bit of spring cleaning was in order, so to that end I've switched the site to a
new theme, and moved from disqus to a lighter-weight commenting system.

## Comments

First, I thought about disabling comments entirely, but I actually get the odd
interesting discussion here, so decided to switch to something faster and more
privacy focussed.

After a fairly short search, I found [commento](https://commento.io/), and
decided it was exactly what I wanted. I've imported the comments from
[disqus](https://disqus.com/), and hopefully they mostly appear alongside the
correct posts. Rather than host my own copy, I'm currently using the hosted
version, and so far it's pretty good and very fast.

## Theme

I searched the [hugo](https://gohugo.io)
[theme gallery](https://themes.gohugo.io/) and found the theme
[slim](https://themes.gohugo.io/slim/) most closely matched what I was looking
for. Until now, I'd been using a hacked up copy of
[hyde](https://themes.gohugo.io/hyde/), but every hugo upgrade left me with
more warnings and so I decided to go lighter-weight.

I [forked slim](https://github.com/mattfoster/hugo-theme-slim) and made a few
changes to add various links, some custom shortcodes and some CSS tweaks and the
result is what you see here. Hopefully it's easy on the eye aNd nice to read!

## :wave:

Hopefully with the refreshed designed I'll remember to post a bit more! I have
a few ongoing projects and a _lot_ of music I could post about, so watch this space.

## Update

I've noticed a couple of problems with commentio which I didn't see during my
initial testing. Mainly, the login form doesn't work entirely. To work around
this, login and then refresh the page -- it works but just doesn't properly
reload because of a JS error. Anonymous commenting works file, so feel free to
use that.
