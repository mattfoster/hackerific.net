February was a quiet month in music, so I decided to skip it and bundle it with
March, which has been much more noisy. This post has a few new releases from
the last couple of months, and I've tried to include links to youtube videos
and Apple Music where I can.

This post contains some high quality metal, so
read on for the details, and feel free to feed me suggestions!

### Oceans of Slumber - Winter

This album is seriously awesome, when I first heard it I was surprised I'd not
come across these guys previously, but then I discovered that they're pretty
new, and their only past release is an [EP](https://itun.es/gb/pl4g9).
The EP has an excellent cover of
[Solitude](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e91SnsQS1O8), by Candlemass, so
check it out!

Listen to Winter on [Apple Music](https://itun.es/gb/KWHQ_), and follow up with
[Blue](https://itun.es/gb/pl4g9).

### Magnetic Seasons - Mugstar

I don't usually read [The Quietus](http://thequietus.com/), but it can be a
great place to discover new music, and it's how I found Mugstar.
The Quietus' review is literally a track-by-track description, which is a
little odd if you ask me, but you can [stream the album there](http://thequietus.com/articles/19797-listen-new-mugstar-album),
so it's worth a look.

This is an excellent instrumental psychedlic rock album, with an old-school
feel. Exactly the type of thing I like listening to while working.

Listen on [Apple Music](https://itun.es/gb/klPqab).

## Omnium Gatherum - Grey Heavens

Yes, upbeat sounding gothy death metal is a thing, and this is it! This has a
nice and heavy backing with some cool riffs, and sounds particularly nice
played loud.

Listen on [Apple Music](https://itun.es/gb/RaUv_).

## Boris with Merzbow - Gensho

One of the things you miss if you just discover music with streaming services
is things like this. I found this on Apple Music's New page, for metal, and
listened to it. Cool, I thought, this is pretty awesome, some Sunn like stuff,
with nice vocals, and then some crazy noise at the end.

And then, I found this:

Which told me to play the Boris and Merzbow tracks in sync, and WHAOH! It's awesome.

Here's another track, play this at the same time and you'll see what I mean.

Listen on [Apple Music](https://itun.es/gb/T2sF_), although I'm not sure how to
play multiple tracks at once with iTunes.
