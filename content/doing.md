I read a lot of fiction and try to keep learning interesting things. I also
listen to a load of music, mainly on the darker end of the spectrum.
Inspired by various blogs I decided to track what I've been consuming in 2025,
mainly in case I find it interesting later.

Also see my [projects](/projects) page, which is a giant jumble of projects
I've either done or started.
