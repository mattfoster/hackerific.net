I currently acquire projects far faster than I can actually make progress on
them. This page will list a few, along with current status information to help
jostle me into action. I seem to have made a load of kits, so this won't list
them all!

## Completed

* `badges`: I made PCB badges for a Chistmas party in [2023, 2024 and 2025](https://hackerific.net/2024/12/17/christmas-badge-buildathon/). 
* `pcb-toaster`: I added a PID controller to a toaster oven to let me [bake PCBs](https://hackerific.net/2021/11/13/pcb-toaster/). 
* `digirig`: I bought a [digirig](https://digirig.net/category/hardware/), in March 2021.
  This is a combined audio and USB-serial interface for controlling ham radios.
  I built cables for use with my FT818ND and it works.
* `sofle`: I built a
  [SofleKeyboard](http://hackerific.net/2021/04/08/building-a-sofle-keyboard/)
  in early 2021.
* `so239 patch panel`: I made an SO239 patch panel using a chunk of rectangular
  section aluminium.
* `n7ddc tuner`: I made an [n7ddc antenna
  tuner](https://github.com/Dfinitski/N7DDC-ATU-100-mini-and-extended-boards)
  using a kit from eBay. This is built but currently untested and has no box...
  I'm so bad at putting things in boxes!
* `diode modulator`: I made a DIY diode modulator to experiment with. It was
  interesting to see the signals magically do what they were supposed to and to
  learn how it works (hint: get the ARRL handbook). 
* `mechanical keyboards`: I've made a few mechanical keyboards, including two
  GH-60 Satan boards, some gherkins and a gherkin express.
* `PowerPole PDUs`: I made some Anderson PowerPole PDUs for my gear, using kits
  from [sotabeams](https://www.sotabeams.co.uk/powerpole-fused-dc-connector-box/).
* `EFHW` `: I made a 40m EFHW antenna from a [sotabeams](https://www.sotabeams.co.uk) kit.
* `QRP Labs 50W PA`: I made a [QRP Labs](http://shop.qrp-labs.com/50wpa) power
  amplifier kit. It was hard work because `g0upl` loves really compact boards.
* `pi timeserver`: I made a Raspberry Pi into an NTP server by connecting a GPS
  receiver and using it's PPS output as an accurace time pulse. Basic config is
  in [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/-/snippets/1867454).
* `morse key`: I made a Morse key from
  [qrphamradiokits](https://www.qrphamradiokits.com/cw-keyers/tkey-0-touch-keyer/#cc-m-product-12376892149),
  but I've not learned morse!
* `cordwood puzzle 1`: I did [Cordwood puzzle
  1](https://boldport.com/shop/cordwood-puzzle-1) without cheating!
* `tape antenna`: I made a direction finding antenna out of tape measures. It
  used a gamma match and parameters from a yagi calcualtor I had to run in
  wine. I made some FT8 QSOs with it.
* `wobbulator`: I made a pi wobbulator. [It was
  fun](http://asliceofraspberrypi.blogspot.com/2013/10/raspberry-pi-wobbulator-introduction.html)
  but not as useful as a nanoVNA.
* `RSGB Centenary Receiver`: I made an [RSGB Centenary
  Receiver](https://www.rsgbshop.org/acatalog/PDF/RSGB%20Centenary%20Receiver%20Building%2020m%20Instructions%20V1-5.pdf)
  a few years ago. It was fun and works!
* `oscillator`: I made a basic [Colpits
  oscillator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colpitts_oscillator) for my
  intermediate amateur radio practical. 

## Pending

* `felinet boards`: I ordered some boards and parts to build [felinet](https://cats.radio) hardware. I've made a pi hat. 
* `open-sleeve`: I've started building an Open Sleeve dipole for the 10m and 6m
  bands, as detailed in RadCom April 2021. I've bought some metal poles, nylon
  base and saddle clips, but I'm still awaiting part of the metal I need. 
* `tnc-pi`: I bought a [TNC-pi](http://tnc-x.com/TNCPi.htm) ages ago. The kit
  is built and seems to work but I've not attached it to a radio. That sounds
  like it should be easy but I fought with a baofeng for ages before giving up!
