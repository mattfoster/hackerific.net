I'm Matt, an Internet Services Manager at [Netcraft][1]. Opinions expressed
here are my own, not those of my employer.

My work consists of managing and maintaining Netcraft's scanning software,
performing [PCI scans][4], security testing, consulting and systems
administration.

I have a PhD from the [University of Bath][2], on the application of novel
image processing techniques to sparse remotely sensed data. You can read my
at [Thesis][18]. You can find freely available copies of my academic work
[here][19].

I live with my partner, [Charlie Beldon][3], in Wiltshire, fairly near
Bath, where houses are affordable and commutes to Bath are short. Charlie is a
professional dog trainer and behaviourist.

In my spare time, which sometimes encroaches into work time, I like to climb,
walk, hack bits of code (usually in scripting languages like Ruby and Perl, but
sometimes shell code or C), mess with electronics, break this website, [take
photos][6], play console games, read books and watch sci-fi. I also run (slowly)
and am completely addicted to [Zombies Run!][20].

Last but not least, I have an amateur radio license, and since 2018
my callsign has been M0PUH. Find me on [QRZ][22].
