Matt is an Internet Services Developer at [Netcraft][1]. He feels the need to stress that the opinions expressed here are his own.

He now has a PhD from the [University of Bath][2], UK, after surviving the examination process, and is very pleased that he graduated whilst still at the youthful age of 25.

He lives with the lovely (Dr) [Charlie Beldon][3], in the centre of Bath, surrounded by [pretty buildings][4], and [parks][5]. He'd like to live somewhere like this when he grows up.

In his spare time, which sometimes encroaches into work time, Matt likes to hack bits of code (usually Ruby, but sometimes shell code or C), break his website, [take photos][6], play console games, [read books][7] and watch sci-fi.

Generally Matt will be found [listening to music][8], including a variety of metal and progressive rock, as well as some other things. At the moment, [Porcupine Tree][9] is probably his favourite.

He doesn't normally talk about himself in the third person, but he stole the idea from [Charles Stross][10], [who did it better][11].
